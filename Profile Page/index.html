        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm John Danmel Laranga, a dedicated student leader at the University of Cabuyao, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. With a profound passion for technology and leadership, I am committed to driving positive change and innovation within my community.

            As the University Captain of the AWS Cloud Club - University of Cabuyao, I lead our efforts to explore and harness cloud computing technologies, fostering a collaborative and dynamic environment for students interested in AWS. In addition, my role as the Director for Resources of the AWS Cloud Club - Philippines allows me to contribute to the national network, overseeing resource management and strategic initiatives that support our mission of advancing cloud computing knowledge and applications across the country.
            
            Beyond my involvement with AWS Cloud Club, I actively engage in various initiatives aimed at enhancing educational experiences and promoting technological advancements. My goal is to empower my peers and contribute to the growth of our tech community, equipping us all with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>
